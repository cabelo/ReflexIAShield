# ReflexIAShield
Intelligence that reacts reflexively to attacks and anomalies

The ReflexIA project proposes an innovative approach to cybersecurity based on generative artificial intelligence. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) integrated into log ingestion and correlation pipelines, the system is capable of identifying anomalies and suspicious behavior in real time. Inspired by the concept of neurological reflexes, ReflexIA not only detects risk events with high precision but also reacts automatically, triggering pre-programmed or adaptive countermeasures such as IP blocking, process termination, intelligent alerts, and forensic triggers.

Combining continuous learning, contextual analysis, and autonomous decision-making, ReflexIA shifts the security paradigm from reactive to proactive and adaptive defenseâ€”minimizing the time between detection and response while enhancing the resilience of digital environments against emerging threats.
